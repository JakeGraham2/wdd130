      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to make a website that has all the fixings of a good comedy show.
        You got your good comics, people that like being in a crowd and are willing to be participants.
        The reason for this website is if you reminisce about the 2010’s with
        me for just a little while, chances are that you’ll remember the flash
        game websites and you probably spent a few too many hours on them same
        as I. Now that you’ve grown up a bit wouldn’t it be nice to instead
        of play childish games, enjoy comedy with friends. Now you’re feeling
        a little more sophisticated about your entertainment choices aren’t you?
        This is a wonderful option for everyone! </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience for this website is primarily young adults age 18-25 to share jokes and fun experiences. 
        It's also imagined that it would be a fun place for teenagers to hang out and show off their comedic chops.
        It'd be quite fun to imagine that the older generation from maybe middle age to elder show off their rich comedic potential.
