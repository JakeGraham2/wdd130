         <p>I'm Jake Graham I am originally from the Pacific Northwest about a half-hour away from Seattle WA. 

            I'm a computer science major and I'm pretty excited about it. Some of my favorite things to do are Mountain biking, playing video games, and watching movies.

            I've been a member all my life and just got home from a full-time mission to Nebraska, Brazil, and Ohio. Covid is the worst.

            And uh my favorite verse right now is part of King Benjamins address to his people which is Mosiah 4:27.
